##  Project Structure

- **Python 3.11+**
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) → User Interface  
- [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) → Multi-Agent Orchestration  
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) → LLM Integrations  
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) → Secure API Key Management  

## How It Works

- This app uses a multi-agent AI workflow:

- Email Reader Agent → Understands the input email and extracts its context.

- Email Writer Agent → Rewrites the email into a polished, professional message with expanded abbreviations.

- Agents are orchestrated via CrewAI + LangChain, making the workflow modular, interpretable, and extensible.

##  Use Cases

- Students writing professional emails to professors or recruiters

- Employees sending client communication

- Managers preparing formal business requests

- Anyone who wants to upgrade casual writing into professional tone instantly

## Future Enhancements

- Add tone customization (formal, friendly, persuasive)

- Multi-language email rewriting

- Integration with Gmail/Outlook APIs

- Slack/Teams bot integration
