🧠 How It Works

This app uses a multi-agent AI workflow:

Email Reader Agent → Understands the input email and extracts its context.

Email Writer Agent → Rewrites the email into a polished, professional message with expanded abbreviations.

Agents are orchestrated via CrewAI + LangChain, making the workflow modular, interpretable, and extensible.
